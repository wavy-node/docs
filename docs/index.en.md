# Wavy Node

Weâ€™re building an API for electronic payment providers and crypto exchanges across Latin America. Our API monitors, analyzes, and detects transactions in real time to help prevent fraud and money laundering â€” tackling a region with the second-highest year-over-year growth in crypto adoption.

Our solution identifies transactions and aligns with regulatory and tax frameworks like the FATF, the Travel Rule, Mexicoâ€™s Fintech Law, and other local regulations. Using AI agents, we generate detailed reports on user activity, run background checks, and deliver risk scores through machine learning â€” automating the investigation process.

This improves compliance and risk management for our clients throughout the region.
